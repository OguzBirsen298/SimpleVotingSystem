# SimpleVotingSystem
This is a simple console application built to simulate a voting system. The program prompts the user to choose a candidate, calculates the number of votes for each candidate, and displays the percentage of votes for each candidate after each vote.
The project's goal is to offer a prototype to digitalize elections which could be a good example for countries that are facing troubles while maintaining their elections manually.
